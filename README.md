# Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

This Python script is designed to classify images as either containing a cat or a dog. It uses a pre-trained deep learning model provided by TensorFlow and a combination of other libraries to preprocess and analyze the images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `os`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (plt)
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `tensorflow`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `sklearn` (scikit-learn)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn tensorflow opencv-python-headless scikit-learn
