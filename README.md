# Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

This Python script classifies images as either containing a cat or a dog using a pre-trained deep learning model provided by TensorFlow and various Python libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `os`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (plt)
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `tensorflow`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `sklearn` (scikit-learn)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn tensorflow opencv-python-headless scikit-learn

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git
cd cat-vs-dog-classifier

Place your test images in a directory called test_images.

Run the script:

bash

    python classify_images.py

    The script will process the images in the test_images directory and provide predictions on whether each image contains a cat or a dog.

Customization

You can customize the classifier's behavior by modifying the script or the model used. Potential customizations include:

    Model Selection: Experiment with different pre-trained models provided by TensorFlow for better accuracy.

    Thresholds: Adjust confidence thresholds for classifying images as cats or dogs.

    Image Preprocessing: Modify image preprocessing steps in the script to suit your dataset better.

    Adding Labels: Extend the script to print or save labels alongside predictions if you have labeled data.
