# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classification

Cat and Dog Image Classification
**Overview**
This repository contains code for a cat and dog image classification project using TensorFlow, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, random, and scikit-learn. The project includes two different models, each with approximately 11 layers, employing dense and flatten layers. The first model achieves an accuracy of over 88%, while the second model achieves approximately 85% accuracy in classifying cat and dog images.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the models consists of a total of 25,000 images, divided into two categories: "cat" and "dog." These images are stored in separate directories within the dataset.

**Models**

Model 1
Architecture: Approximately 11 layers
Key Components: Dense layers, Flatten layer
Accuracy: Over 88%

Model 2
Architecture: Approximately 11 layers
Key Components: Dense layers, Flatten layer
Accuracy: Approximately 85%
